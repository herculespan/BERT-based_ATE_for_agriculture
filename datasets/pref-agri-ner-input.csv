Through the development of the analysis it can be seen how the prevailing guidelines in agrarian economics obstructed the development of a critical perspective on the agrarian policy which was developed in Portugal from the thirties to 1974 insofar as small holding agriculture is concerned,O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O

Smallholding agriculture must be considered on the basis of a large analytical horizon capable of putting it back in its historical dimension and capable too of putting an end to its isolation vis-a-vis the political social and economic realities which transcend the space that has been traditionally associated with it,O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O

Based on the notion of smallholding agriculture which being a vague and imprecise notion has the undeniable potential to serve as a start for an analysis of the complex reality which is the smallholding agriculture in Portugal the author tries to determine the importance it has in this country and then examines the main sectors of it,O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Refusing to accept that the question of modalities can be analysed just on the basis of the existing heterogeneity the author suggests two essential types of criteria: (a) those regarding the subordinate integration of smallholding agriculture in the process of capital accumulation; (b) those stemming from the special inner characteristics of this agricultural stratum,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the case of Portugal the author indicates that three basic modalities should be considered: complementary agriculture mercanitle agriculture and residual agriculture,O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O B-Agr

That niches of competitors in ecological communities are shaped by mutual coevolution which thus allows many species to coexist is a commonly-held view,O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O

In monoculture the grass responded to both P(1)N(1) and P(0)N(1) but not to P(1)N(0),O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard code - in force since 1961 - has been applied to tractor tests for 20 years now,O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O
The number of affiliated countries is 22,O O O O B-Agr O O
As the different countries cover all climatic zones the demand that the tests carried out in the respective countries be comparable could be met only by dispensing deliberately with the field test and confining oneself to technical tests that can be carried out on the test stand or test track independently of weather conditions,O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr I-Agr O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O B-Agr O

Low concentration of K+ promotes the growth of the callus; the induction of morphogenesis (embryos formation) requires higher amounts: 1 mM/l of KH(2)PO(4) seem to be the better,O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The concurrence of a decrease of the concentration of ribosomes and glycoproteins in leaves of potato plants under field conditions and mature plant resistance against potato virus y('N) was studied,O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O B-Agr O B-Agr B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr I-Agr O O O

Tubers were harvested from plants inoculated fourteen days before,B-Agr O O O B-Agr O O O O
Lack of typical virus symptoms on plants grown from these tubers gave information on the presence of mature plant resistance,O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O
It was concluded that in plants which had developed about 20 leaves there was a high degree of mature plant resistance when ribosome- and glycoprotein-contents in the fifteenth leaf was less than 2 and 4 OD(260)/ml/g fresh weight respectively,O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O

During this investigation it was found that in 1976 out of 1466 herds investigated which amounted to a total of around 200000 sheep there was a certain number of abortions,O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O B-Agr

Of 32 experimentally infected cattle these procedures could detect respectively 28 30 and 31 of them,O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O

Young rainbow trout (mean weight: 40 g) were starved for 36 days,O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O O O O O

The proportions of lipid loss as compared to total wet and dry weight loss were 18 and 37% respectively,O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O
During starvation the loss of nonlipid components was 1,O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr O O
The starved trout almost exclusively used neutral lipids (LN:94%) as lipid fuel,O O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O
Thus the phospholipids (LP) represented a negligible energy source,O O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr O
It seems that long-term fasting weight loss involves a breakdown of the membranes as soon as the lipid depots reach values as low as 2% of wet weight,O O O O B-Agr I-Agr O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr I-Agr
