Through the development of the analysis it can be seen how the prevailing guidelines in agrarian economics obstructed the development of a critical perspective on the agrarian policy which was developed in Portugal from the thirties to 1974 insofar as small holding agriculture is concerned,O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O

Smallholding agriculture must be considered on the basis of a large analytical horizon capable of putting it back in its historical dimension and capable too of putting an end to its isolation vis-a-vis the political social and economic realities which transcend the space that has been traditionally associated with it,O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O

Based on the notion of smallholding agriculture which being a vague and imprecise notion has the undeniable potential to serve as a start for an analysis of the complex reality which is the smallholding agriculture in Portugal the author tries to determine the importance it has in this country and then examines the main sectors of it,O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Refusing to accept that the question of modalities can be analysed just on the basis of the existing heterogeneity the author suggests two essential types of criteria: (a) those regarding the subordinate integration of smallholding agriculture in the process of capital accumulation; (b) those stemming from the special inner characteristics of this agricultural stratum,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the case of Portugal the author indicates that three basic modalities should be considered: complementary agriculture mercanitle agriculture and residual agriculture,O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O B-Agr O O B-Agr

In the final part the spatial limits of polarized growth and the incidence of development in the vicinity of a growth center made the author underline the importance of the rural component on the social and economic development,O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O I-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr

In the third type on the other hand it manifests itself solely in a prolongation of the lag-phase; from the moment the algae complete this phase their growth occurs without suffering any apparent inhibition,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O O O O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr
This third type is characteristic of highly toxic metals,O O O O O O O O B-Agr

Rhizosphere samples from rice straw-amended (3 and 6 tons/ha) soil exhibited more pronounced nitrogen-fixing activity than the samples from unamended soil; while the activity of the rhizosphere samples from soils receiving combined nitrogen (40 and 80 kg N/ha) was relatively low,B-Agr B-Agr O B-Agr I-Agr O O O O B-Agr O O O B-Agr O O O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O B-Agr B-Agr O B-Agr O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O

The demand for sprinkler irrigation depends on the amount of water (wpt) available to the plant in the root zone the climatic conditions and on the crop itself,O B-Agr O B-Agr I-Agr O O O O O B-Agr O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Agr O
